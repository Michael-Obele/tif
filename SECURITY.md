## Privacy Note

Since Tech Invoice Forge is an offline-first application that runs entirely in the client's browser using IndexedDB, most data privacy concerns are mitigated by design. No user data is ever sent to our servers. However, vulnerabilities could potentially expose data to other scripts running on the same origin or via XSS. We appreciate your help in identifying and fixing such issues.
